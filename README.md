# Velthuis AutoCorrect for Atom

## Atom Autocorrect

This package provides a framework for implementing real-time, inline corrections while typing. The original from which this package is an adapted copy, can be found on https://github.com/dmoonfire/atom-autocorrect/. The original was written for more automatic changes of common typos such as "teh" or "DOuble LEetters" in English, but has been adapted for the Velthuis system.
